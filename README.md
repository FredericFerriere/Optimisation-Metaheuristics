Includes Different optimization algorithms applied to well known functions.


## Algorithms

### Simulated Annealing

A custom implementation of simulated annealing to better isolate the effect of each parameter and ease how to tweak the parameters to obtain convergence.

Applied to:
  - Rosenbrock (dimensions 2, 5 and 10)
